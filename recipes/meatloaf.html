<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ground Chuck: This recipe calls for ground chuck, but some reviewers like to use other kinds of ground meat (like beef or venison).</li>
    <li>Vegetables: The nearly-pureed carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic will keep the meatloaf moist and flavorful.</li>
    <li>Worcestershire Sauce: A tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce gives the meatloaf its umami-rich flavor.</li>
    <li>Egg: The egg helps bind the meatloaf together.</li>
    <li>Spices: Chef John uses dried Italian herbs, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to season his meatloaf.</li>
    <li>Bread Crumbs: Bread crumbs will bind the meatloaf together.</li>
    <li>Glaze: This meatloaf has a glaze made with brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon mustard, and sriracha.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Chop the Vegetables: Combine the vegetables and garlic in a food processor until nearly pureed.</li>
    <li>Form the Meatloaf: Combine the vegetables, ground chuck, Worcestershire sauce, spices, and egg. Sprinkle in the bread crumbs and mix them with your hands (be careful not to overmix).</li>
    <li>Bake: Form the meat mixture into a loaf and place it in a prepared baking pan. Bake for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the Glaze: Combine brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and sriracha to make the glaze.</li>
    <li>Glaze the Meatloaf: Spoon the glaze over the slightly hot meatloaf. Return meatloaf to the oven and bake until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F.</li>
